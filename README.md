# Caesar_Cipher_Encryption_Decryption
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest known substitution ciphers. It is named after Julius Caesar, who is reputed to have used it to communicate with his generals.

In the Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' as 'E', and so on. The alphabet "wraps around" so that 'X' would be encrypted as 'A', 'Y' as 'B', and 'Z' as 'C'.
